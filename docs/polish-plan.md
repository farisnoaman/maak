# Polish plan

The product was built phase by phase and gated on correctness: every command is validated in SQL, every screen has a
test, every string exists in two languages. What no phase owned is how it **reads**. This file is that queue, and it
starts with the page a stranger sees first.

Status: `[x]` done · `[~]` deliberately deferred (reason written out) · `[ ]` queued.

---

## The diagnosis

The home page was a build report wearing a landing page's clothes. Its own output, verbatim:

| What is on the page | Why it is wrong |
| --- | --- |
| `المرحلة 2 — الجغرافيا والأماكن` as the eyebrow | A phase number means something to the people who built it and nothing to a passenger |
| `367 اختبار وحدة ناجح` as a hero stat | The test count grew to 669 and the number on the page did not — a statistic that only ever lies |
| `الأساس التقني` — three cards about one write path, shared logic, i18n | Architecture is a reason to trust the product later; it is not why someone visiting Sana'a→Aden stays |
| `المنصات` — seven console cards, each with a phase pill, five of them `قريبًا` | Two thirds of the first screen promised things that do not exist |
| `جرّب حساب السعر — نفس الدالة التي تعمل على الخادم` | The calculator is a good idea described in the wrong language |
| `المرحلة 2 · Next.js · Expo · Supabase` in the footer | A stack list is a hiring page, not a travel site |

Meanwhile `/trips` was returning six real published trips with real prices and seat counts, and the home page showed
none of them. **The polish job is not a repaint: it is using the data that already exists to answer a traveller's
questions in the order they ask them.**

## The principles

1. **The first screen sells the trip, not the build.** Anything that describes how the software was made belongs in
   `docs/`, not above the fold.
2. **Real data or nothing.** No invented numbers, no placeholder `367`, no "1,200 happy passengers" until there are
   actual bookings to count. A section with no data says so, or does not render.
3. **Every block answers "what do I do next".** Feature, then proof, then a door.
4. **Internal surfaces stay reachable, quietly.** The consoles are not deleted — they move below the product and into
   the footer, without phase pills.
5. **No new dependencies, no new design language.** The tokens (`packages/design-tokens/tokens.css`) and the existing
   class vocabulary already carry the look; polish is hierarchy, copy and data, not a framework.
6. **A11y and RTL are part of polished, not a pass afterwards.** Every new block is logical-property CSS, keyboard
   reachable, and swept by `check:a11y`.

## The queue

| # | Surface | The honest problem | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Home** (`/[locale]`) | Reads as a build report; ignores the trips it could show; promises five consoles | `[x]` rebuilt |
| 2 | Header + footer | 8 nav links including *المركبات* and *دليل المكوّنات*; no footer anywhere but home | `[x]` trimmed nav, shared `SiteFooter` |
| 3 | Trips list (`/trips`) | Strong already (filters, keyset paging, facets) — but the empty state and the first load are worth a pass | `[ ]` |
| 4 | Trip detail (`/trips/[code]`) | Dense metadata; the booking button competes with badges | `[ ]` |
| 5 | Booking + pay (`/book`, `/pay`) | Two flows that work; the pay screen is the one people screenshot when it goes wrong | `[ ]` |
| 6 | Account (`/account`) | Lists are correct, hierarchy is flat — "next departure" should be the first thing | `[ ]` |
| 7 | Auth (`/auth/*`) | Fine, but the sign-in form is the last place a person should meet jargon | `[ ]` |
| 8 | Operator console | Dense tables are right for the job; the **overview** answers nothing at a glance | `[ ]` |
| 9 | Staff + finance | Same: correct, unranked | `[ ]` |
| 10 | Mobile shell (`apps/mobile`) | Mirrors the same problem: the home screen is a list of links, one of them labelled *المرحلة* | `[ ]` |
| 11 | Empty / error / loading states | The states a demo never shows and a launch always hits | `[ ]` |

## 1. Home — what changed

**Structure, top to bottom**

1. **Hero** — an eyebrow that describes the product (*حجز مقاعد بين المحافظات*), a headline about the traveller's
   trip, the search form, then three trust lines instead of three test statistics. The aside is *أقرب الانطلاقات*:
   up to three real departures with time, seats left and price, linking to the trip.
2. **Trips you can book now** — up to six real `PublicTripCard`s from `search_public_trips`, sorted featured. Empty
   means an honest sentence, not a fake card.
3. **Popular destinations** — the destination facets the search function already computes, as chips with counts.
   Hidden entirely when there is nothing to show.
4. **How booking works** — three steps: search, book and pay, travel and follow.
5. **Know the price before you book** — the fare calculator, kept, because it is a real feature, with its dev-facing
   caption replaced by the passenger's question.
6. **Operator band** — the one place the product speaks to a supply-side visitor, in their words.
7. **For teams** — the consoles, as one quiet row of links, no phases, no `قريبًا`.
8. **Footer** — brand, three link groups (travel / platform / information), a rights line.

**Deliberately not done here**

- `[~]` **A marketing hero image or illustration.** Generated art on a travel home page is a taste decision for the
  owner, and a placeholder gradient would be worse than the current token-driven gradient.
- `[~]` **Testimonials / passenger counts.** There is no data behind either. Inventing them is the `367` mistake
  again with a friendlier face.
- `[~]` **Dark-mode redesign.** The tokens already flip; the audit is a pass of its own.

**Verification** — `npm run check:all` (guards, lint, format, types, 669 tests), `npm run check:a11y` over every route
including both locales of the home page, and the rendered HTML read back with the tags stripped, because a home page's
job is its text.
